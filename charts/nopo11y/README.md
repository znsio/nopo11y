**Note** - If you have nopo11y-stack >= 1.3.1 installed then you don't have to use nopo11y helm chart, the nopo11y-stack has nopo11y-operator which is a replacement of nopo11y helm chart, please check [this](https://github.com/znsio/nopo11y/tree/main/tools/nopo11y-operator) to know more about nopo11y-operator
# Introduction

Nopo11y is a wrapper on top of nopo11y-stack, using nopo11y one can create basic dashboards with golder signals, alerts and SLOs for every microservice.

# How to install?

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts. Please refer to
Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs) to get started.

Once Helm has been set up correctly, add the repo as follows:

    helm repo add znsio https://znsio.github.io/nopo11y

If you had already added this repo earlier, run following command to retrieve the latest versions of the packages,

    helm repo update

To install the chart:

    helm install <service_name>-nopo11y znsio/nopo11y

To uninstall the chart:

    helm delete <service_name>-nopo11y
To add it as a dependency in your service's chart add below lines in your service's Chart.yaml file
```yaml
dependencies:
- condition: nopo11y.enabled
  name: nopo11y
  repository: https://znsio.github.io/nopo11y
  version: 2.1.0
```
